        <p>
            Project Tirtha is an academic initiative to create 3D models of heritage
            sites, using crowdsourced images. The word <i>Tirtha</i> is Sanskrit
            for "a place of pilgrimage", and is commonly used to refer to the sacred
            sites of Hinduism. Our goal is to preserve and showcase the beauty and cultural
            significance of heritage sites. We believe that by allowing the general public
            to contribute to the creation of these models, and by providing open access to
            these models, we can increase awareness and appreciation of these
            important cultural landmarks and inspire future generations to maintain
            them for years to come.
