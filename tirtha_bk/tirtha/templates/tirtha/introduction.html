        <p>
            Project Tirtha is an academic initiative to create 3D models of heritage 
            sites, using crowdsourced images. The word <i>Tirtha</i> is Sanskrit 
            for "a place of pilgrimage", and is commonly used to refer to the sacred 
            sites of Hinduism. Our goal is to preserve and showcase the beauty and cultural 
            significance of heritage sites. We believe that by allowing the general public 
            to contribute to the creation of these models, and by providing open access to 
            these models, we can increase awareness and appreciation of these 
            important cultural landmarks and inspire future generations to maintain 
            them for years to come.
