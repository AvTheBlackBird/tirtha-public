# Project Tirtha [BETA]

Project Tirtha is an academic initiative to create 3D models of heritage 
sites, using crowdsourced images. The word *Tirtha* is Sanskrit 
for "a place of pilgrimage", and is commonly used to refer to the sacred sites of 
Hinduism. Our goal is to preserve and showcase the beauty and cultural 
significance of heritage sites, with a focus on temples. We believe that 
by providing access to these models, we can increase awareness 
and appreciation of these important cultural landmarks, and inspire future 
generations to maintain them for years to come.

The project is currently in its early stages, and is not yet ready for
public use. However, you can contribute to the project by submitting 
images by clicking on the "Contribute" button. Please read 
[How do I contribute?](https://tirtha.niser.ac.in/#instructions) before proceeding.
You can also contribute by [reporting bugs here](https://github.com/smlab-niser/tirtha-public/issues/new/choose).

This project will also be open-sourced in the near future, so stay tuned!

## List of known issues
- [ ] On Chrome / Chromium-based browsers (Edge, Brave, Opera), models might be displayed without lighting (dark, texture-less). We are working on a fix. In the meantime, you can use Firefox on Android to view the models properly. See https://github.com/smlab-niser/tirtha-public/issues/1 & https://github.com/smlab-niser/tirtha-public/issues/2.
